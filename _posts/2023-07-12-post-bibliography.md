This post shows how to add bibliography to simple blog posts. We can cite conference presentations like {% cite rasmont2024IPPW2024 %}, or multiple citations like {% cite rasmont2024IPPW2024 rasmontScitech2024 %}. We can also include long references like {% reference RASMONT2020212 %} or quotes:

{% quote rasmont2023concentration %}
Concentration measurements in dense ejecta clouds using millimeter-wave radar tomography.
{% endquote %}
