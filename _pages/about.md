I am a PhD candidate in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research focuses on rocket propulsion, plume-surface interactions, and innovative sensing techniques for space applications.

## Research Interests

- Rocket Propulsion
- Plume-Surface Interactions
- Planetary Dust
- Entry, Descent & Landing
- Multiphase Flows
- Radar Sensing
- Computational Fluid Dynamics
- Computational Geometry
- Space Systems

## Current Research

My current work involves experimental studies of plume-surface interactions during planetary landings, with a focus on non-intrusive diagnostics. Key aspects include:

- Designing and building a 2000L vacuum facility with a Mach 5 cold gas thruster for PSI experiments.
- Developing an innovative mmWave radar interferometer for measuring particle concentrations in opaque particle-laden flows.
- Creating physics-based models of ejecta trajectories to reconstruct 3D ejecta concentrations, velocities, and erosion mass fluxes.

This research is funded by a NASA ESI Grant and a NASA FINESST Fellowship.
